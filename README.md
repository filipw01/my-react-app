This project is a card game built with React to learn this amazing tool.


## Rules (first prototype)

Each player can play a card and in his next turn attack with it. The attacks are performed one after another, but you has to declare all moves before any of these actually start.

A card has:
* Attack
* Health
* Agility
* Class (melee, ranged)

If you have higher or equal agility than your opponent it's sure that you will success

If you have lower agility than your opponent there is a chance for you but you can also fail action.

Melee class deals damage equal to it's attack but also receives damage equal to opponent's attack.
